# Custom Pact Spell Level

With this module the maximum Pact Spell Level can be overwritten.

## Installation / Usage

1. install the package according to the usual FoundryVTT procedure
2. open Manage Modules
3. activate the module
4. open Configure Settings
5. open Custom Pact Spell Level
6. set Max Pact Spell Level and add the names of the characters that are allowed to have an increased pact level

Important! If several characters have a changed max level, they must be separated with ";". E.g. Tree;Dog. If the line is left blank, no one will get the settings.

## Supported Systems

I've only tested it with the systems below.
